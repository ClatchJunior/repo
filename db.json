      "description": "This five red bases, two are dedicated to salami (fennel and regular), and there s a classic capricciosa or beef carpaccio. Blanco options include a mushroom, and a four-cheese extravaganza featuring great lobes of a tangy fior di latte they make in house every day (more on this later). Classic, precise, good.I think it s still better to think of this venue not as a pizzeria, but as Pizza, by Di Stasio.Rinaldo Di Stasio and Mallory Wall s empire, including the original restaurant and bar in St Kilda, Citta and now Carlton, is a designer label for dining.",
